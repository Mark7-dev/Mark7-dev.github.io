            <h1>Finding a safe vehicle</h1>
            <p>
                Vehicle age and safety are major factors
                contributing to road fatalities, and choosing
                a safer vehicle can greatly improve your chances
                of surviving a crash. Modern vehicles can even prevent
                a crash in the first place.
            </p>
            <h3>Not all cars are built equally safe</h3>
            <p>
                While features like front airbags are
                standard in most new cars, other advanced
                safety technologies may not be. Key safety
                features to consider in both new and used vehicles include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronic Stability Control (ESC)</li>
                <li>Autonomous Emergency Braking</li>
                <li>Collision Avoidance Systems</li>
                <li>Lane Departure Warning</li>
                <li>Reverse Camera</li>
                <li>Low speed collision avoidance systems</li>
                <li>Blind Spot Warning</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>When buying a new car safety should be a priority</h3>

            <h1 id="speeding">Speeding</h1>

            <p>Speeds just over 5 km/h above the speed limit in urban areas, and <span style="font-size: x-large;">10 km/h above the speed limit in rural areas, are sufficient to double the risk of a crash.</span></p>
            <p>Speeding is a contributing factor in about 41% of road fatalities and 24% of serious injuries each year in Australia.</p>
            <p>Around half of all serious speeding accidents occur at less than 10km/h above the speed limit.</p>

            <h2>What can you do?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Slowing Down: </b>Research has shown that
                    decreasing vehicle speeds by 5 km/h
                    on roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h
                    produced an 11.9% reduction in serious
                    crashes. Reducing vehicle speeds by a
                    further 5 km/h (i.e. by 10 km/h) would result
                    in a 17.3% reduction in all serious crashes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Maintaining a Safe Following Distance:</b> Keep enough space between your car and the one in front to give yourself time to react.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Checking Road Conditions:</b> Be cautious of wet, icy, or uneven roads, which can reduce traction and increase stopping distances. As seen in the graph, wet roads considerably increase the distance to stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adjusting Speed to Weather:</b> Slow down in adverse conditions such as rain, fog, or snow, where visibility and control are reduced.

            <ul>
                <li><b>Young people</b> are the most at-risk for drunk driving. NHTSA data shows that drivers between the ages of 21-24 account for 29 percent of all fatal alcohol-impaired crashes</li>

                <li>
                    <b>Slowing down reaction time:</b> reducing
                    the ability to perform in an emergency.

                <li>
                   <b>Causing poor judgement:</b> reducing the
                    ability to judge distances and speeds of
                    other vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reducing attention span:</b> reducing the
                    ability to notice other drivers/vehicles.

                <li>

                <li>
                    Completely separate drinking from driving:
                    If you plan on drinking, don't drive at all. Call a taxi, use a ride-share app, or take public transport to get home.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Designating a ‘dry’ driver who will not be

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Young adults</b> (18-24 years) are less likely to
                        wear seat belts than older adults
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Men are less likely to wear seat belts than women and are nearly twice as likely to die in road crashes due to not wearing one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rear seat passengers are less likely to wear seat belts compared to those in the front, which increases the risk of injury to both themselves and others in the vehicle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why seat belts are effective</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cause the occupant to decelerate at the
                        same rate as the vehicle in a crash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread the force of the impact over the
                        stronger parts of the occupant’s body
                        (pelvis and chest area).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prevent the occupant colliding with the
                        interior parts of the vehicle and other
                        vehicle occupants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce the risk of being thrown from the
                        vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In modern cars, seat belts are designed
                        to work together with the airbags. In a
                        crash, the seat belt slows the speed of the
                        occupant, so they impact safely with the
                        airbag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One person who does not wear a seatbelt also serves as a risk to others.
