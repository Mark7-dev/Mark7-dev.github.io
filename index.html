            <h1>Finding a safe vehicle</h1>
            <p>
                Vehicle age and safety are major factors
                contributing to road fatalities, and choosing
                a safer vehicle can greatly improve your chances
                of surviving a crash. Modern vehicles can even prevent
                a crash in the first place.
            </p>
            <h3>Not all cars are built equally safe</h3>
            <p>
                While features like front airbags are
                standard in most new cars, other advanced
                safety technologies may not be. Key safety
                features to consider in both new and used vehicles include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Electronic Stability Control (ESC)</li>
                <li>Autonomous Emergency Braking</li>
                <li>Collision Avoidance Systems</li>
                <li>Lane Departure Warning</li>
                <li>Reverse Camera</li>
                <li>Low speed collision avoidance systems</li>
                <li>Blind Spot Warning</li>
            </ul>
            <img id="col" src = "images/collision.jpeg" alt = "Collision Detection"/>


            <h3>When buying a new car safety should be a priority</h3>

            <h1 id="speeding">Speeding</h1>

            <p>Speeds just over 5 km/h above the speed limit in urban areas, and <span style="font-size: x-large;">10 km/h above the speed limit in rural areas, are sufficient to double the risk of a crash.</span></p>
            <p>Speeding is a contributing factor in about 41% of road fatalities and 24% of serious injuries each year in Australia.</p>
            <p>Around half of all serious speeding accidents occur at less than 10km/h above the speed limit.</p>

            <h2>What can you do?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Slowing Down: </b>Research has shown that
                    decreasing vehicle speeds by 5 km/h
                    on roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h
                    produced an 11.9% reduction in serious
                    crashes. Reducing vehicle speeds by a
                    further 5 km/h (i.e. by 10 km/h) would result
                    in a 17.3% reduction in all serious crashes

                <li>
                    <b>Maintaining a Safe Following Distance:</b> Keep enough space between your car and the one in front to give yourself time to react.

                <li>
                    <b>Checking Road Conditions:</b> Be cautious of wet, icy, or uneven roads, which can reduce traction and increase stopping distances. As seen in the graph, wet roads considerably increase the distance to stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adjusting Speed to Weather:</b> Slow down in adverse conditions such as rain, fog, or snow, where visibility and control are reduced.

                    Completely separate drinking from driving:

                    Designating a ‘dry’ driver who will not be

                <h3>Who is most at risk</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Young adults</b> (18-24 years) are less likely to
                        wear seat belts than older adults
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Men are less likely to wear seat belts than women and are nearly twice as likely to die in road crashes due to not wearing one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rear seat passengers are less likely to wear seat belts compared to those in the front, which increases the risk of injury to both themselves and others in the vehicle.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why seat belts are effective</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Cause the occupant to decelerate at the
                        same rate as the vehicle in a crash.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Spread the force of the impact over the
                        stronger parts of the occupant’s body
                        (pelvis and chest area).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prevent the occupant colliding with the
                        interior parts of the vehicle and other
                        vehicle occupants.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce the risk of being thrown from the
                        vehicle.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In modern cars, seat belts are designed
                        to work together with the airbags. In a
                        crash, the seat belt slows the speed of the
                        occupant, so they impact safely with the
                        airbag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        One person who does not wear a seatbelt also serves as a risk to others.

                            Practicing good sleep habits and getting
                            enough sleep each night is an important

                            shifting in your seat are early signs of
                            sleepiness and indicate you should think
                            about taking a break, experiencing heavy

                            Swapping drivers, using rest

                <p>
                    Driver distraction, including mobile
                    phones, is one of the main causes of road
                    crashes, accounting for approximately
                    1 in 4 car crashes
                </p>
                <p>
                    While a vehicle is moving (or stationary but not in park) the driver cannot use a mobile device. The driver cannot hold the device, rest the device on their body, clothing or on an item on their lap, or operate any function of the device, including for video calling, texting, emailing, social media, web browsing or photography.

                <h3>Who is at risk?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Teenagers: </b>A higher percentage of drivers ages 15–20 were distracted than drivers age 21 and older. Among these younger drivers, 9% of them were distracted at the time of the crash</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What can you do</h3>
                <p>
                    Never look at a mobile
                    whilst driving (even
                    when stopped at a red
                    light). Pull over safely &
                    park your vehicle before
                    using your mobile phone.
                </p>
