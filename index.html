            <h2>Most of these car crashes could have been avoided</h2>
            <p>By learning about the 5 main causes of car crashes you could avoid a potentially life ending accident. The 5 main causes of road accidents include:</p>

            <h1 id="speeding">Speeding</h1>
            <p>Speeds just over 5 km/h above the speed limit in urban areas, and 10 km/h above the speed limit in rural areas, are sufficient to <b>double</b> the risk of a crash.</p>
            <p>Speeding is a contributing factor in about 41% of road fatalities and 24% of serious injuries each year in Australia.</p>
            <p>Around half of all serious speeding accidents occur at less than 10km/h above the speed limit.</p>

            <h2>What can you do?</h2>

            <ol>
                <li><b>Slowing Down: </b>Research has shown that
                    decreasing vehicle speeds by 5 km/h
                    on roads with a speed limit of 60 km/h
                    produced an 11.9% reduction in serious
                    crashes. Reducing vehicle speeds by a
                    further 5 km/h (i.e. by 10 km/h) would result
                    in a 17.3% reduction in all serious crashes
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Maintaining a Safe Following Distance:</b> Keep enough space between your car and the one in front to give yourself time to react.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Checking Road Conditions:</b> Be cautious of wet, icy, or uneven roads, which can reduce traction and increase stopping distances. As seen in the graph, wet roads considerably increase the distance to stop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Adjusting Speed to Weather:</b> Slow down in adverse conditions such as rain, fog, or snow, where visibility and control are reduced.

            <p>1 in 5 drivers killed on our roads have a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) .05 or higher.</p>
            <h3>How does alcohol affect driving</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Slowing down reaction time: reducing
                    the ability to perform in an emergency.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Causing poor judgement: reducing the
                    ability to judge distances and speeds of
                    other vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reducing attention span: reducing the
                    ability to notice other drivers/vehicles.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Causing blurred vision and reduced
                    hearing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating over-confidence: makes you more likely to take risks.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p>Casualty crash risk <span style="font-size: x-large;">doubles</span> when driving with a BAC just in excess of <span style="font-size: x-large;">0.05</span>. That's only 1 pint of beer!</p>
